# Nucleo64 Guitar DSP - firmware
The aim of this project is to implement guitar effects using a nucleo64-f411
board as DSP and using the Rust language. Project progress slowly, and code,
git history, dependencies management are a bit messy because the project
require HAL features that aren't implemented. I generally implement here, those
feature in dirty way first, then I try to cleanly implement them in their
dedicated crate, to finally use the new or updated crate.
